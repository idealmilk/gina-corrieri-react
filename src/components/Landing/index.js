        <p>CLOTHING HAS THE POWER TO MANIFEST YOUR MIND AND VALUES.</p>
        <p>IN THE 1960s MY MATERNAL GRANDPARENTS LEFT SAN FERNANDO, TRINIDAD TO COME TO <span style={{color: "red"}}>LONDON</span>, ALSO THE CITY WHERE MY ITALIAN PATERNAL GRANDFATHER LIVED WITH MY NORTHERN ENGLISH GRANDMOTHER.</p>
        <p>IN THE 1980s MY PARENTS MET AT UNIVERSITY, MY DAD WAS A PUNK AND MY MUM LOVED DISCO.</p>
        <p>MIXTURES AND FUSIONS FEEL NATURAL TO ME, OFTEN MELDING WITH A SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY.</p>
        <p>I HAVE GROWN UP WONDERING WHERE MY PLACE IN THE WORLD IS.</p>
        <p>PHENOMENA IS MY WORLD WITHOUT BOUNDARIES. A SURREAL, INCANDESCENT PLACE INSPIRED BY THE LATE 1970s REGGAE SCENE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON PUNK IN LONDON; BOTH WERE ROOTED IN THE CITY EXPERIENCE AND BONDED PEOPLE THROUGH MUSIC AND A SHARED RESISTANCE TO THE SYSTEM.</p>
        <p>I USE HEAT AS A METAPHOR FOR DEFIANCE.</p>
        <p>THE FABRIC IS UNIQUE TO EACH PIECE, AND CANNOT BE REPLICATED.</p>
